# sever-discord-website


the website was based on the project at the link https://github.com/mdn/beginner-html-site-styled it was modified and changed, including the css style 

thus, I renounce the copyrights to this project, the licenses cover the original project which I linked 

in the "strona" folder there is the whole project, but I also separated files such as css styles and a photo
